# Samsung S6 Edge Data Backup

# Overview

This directory contains bash scripts written to backup audio, image and video files from Samsung S6 Edge device, which is continuously restarting few seconds after the boot-up.

This directory contains bash scripts to backup all the files in device's internal storage as well.

Although it is written for Samsung S6 Edge device, it can be easily adjusted for any device if you can fulfil following prerequisites.

# Prerequisites

* `Ubuntu` machine.

* `adb` tool installed in machine.

* Verify `adb` connection between the machine and device before running scripts.

* Change `internal_storage_path` environment variable value according to your device's internal storage path.

## Scripts

* `list_all_audio_in_device.sh` - finds all audio files in device's internal storage and write to a file called `audio_files` line by line.

* `list_all_images_in_device.sh` - finds all image files in device's internal storage and write to a file called `image_files` line by line.

* `list_all_videos_in_device.sh` - finds all video files in device's internal storage and write to a file called `image_files` line by line.

* `list_all_files_in_device_sdcard.sh` - finds all files in device's internal storage (sdcard refers to the internal storage) and write to a file called `all_files` line by line.

* `backup_audio_files.sh` - Uses `backup_files.sh` to backup all audio files listed in the file `audio_files`. File will be saved to `backup/audio` directory.

* `backup_image_files.sh` - Uses `backup_files.sh` to backup all audio files listed in the file `image_files`. File will be saved to `backup/images` directory.

* `backup_video_files.sh` - Uses `backup_files.sh` to backup all video files listed in the file `video_files`. File will be saved to `backup/videos` directory.

* `backup_files.sh` - Contains core functionality of pulling files one by one from device. This script handles device disconnections and starts backup again once connected.

* `helper_functions.sh` - Contains helper functions and variables used by all above scripts.
